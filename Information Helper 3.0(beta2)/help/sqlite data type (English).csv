Data Type,Type,Describe
bit,integer,"The bit data type is an integer, and its value can only be 0, 1, or null. This data type is used to store data that has only two possible values, such as Yes or No, True or False, On or Off"
int,integer,The int data type can store integers from -231 (-2147483648) to 231(2147483 647). Almost any numeric data stored in a database can be used with this data type. This data type takes up four bytes in the database
smallint,integer,The SmallInt data type can store integers from -215 (-32768) to 215(32767). This data type is useful for storing numeric data that is often confined to a certain range. This data type takes up 2 bytes in the database
tinyint,integer,The TinyInt data type can store integers from 0 to 255. It is useful when you are only going to store a finite number of values. This data type takes up 1 byte in the database
numeric,Accurate numerical,The numeric data type is the same as the DECIMAL type
decimal,Accurate numerical,"The DECIMAL data type can be used to store numeric data of fixed precision and range from -1038-1 to 1038-1. When using this data type, you must specify the range and precision. The range is the total number of digits that can be stored to the left and right of the decimal point. Accuracy is the number of digits stored to the right of the decimal point"
money,money,"The Money data type is used to represent money and currency values. This data type can store data ranging from -922 billion to 922 billion, down to 1/10,000th of a monetary unit"
smallmoney,money,"The SmallMoney data type is used to represent money and currency values. This data type can store data from -214748.3648 to 214748.3647, accurate to one thousandth of a monetary unit"
float,approximate number,The float data type is an approximate numeric type used for floating point numbers. Floating-point numbers are approximate because not all numbers within their range can be represented accurately. The floating point number can be any number from -1.79e +308 to 1.79E+308
real,approximate number,"The REAL data type, like floating point numbers, is an approximate numeric type. It can represent a floating point number with a value between -3.40e +38 and 3.40E+38"
datetime,Date/time,"The datetime data type is used to represent the date and time. This data type stores all date and time data from January 1, 1753 to December 31, 9999, accurate to one hundredth of a second, or 3.33 milliseconds"
Smalldatetime,Date/time,"The SmalldateTime data type is used to represent the date and time between January 1, 1900 and June 6, 2079, accurate to one minute"
cursor,special,The cursor data type is a special data type that contains a reference to a cursor. This data type is used in stored procedures and cannot be used when creating tables
timestamp,special,"TIMESTAMP datatype is a special datatype used to create a unique number within a database. There can only be one TIMESTAMP column in a table. The value of the TIMESTAMP column changes each time a row is inserted or modified. Despite the ""time"" in its name, the TIMESTAMP column is not a date that people recognize. In a database, timestamp values are unique"
Uniqueidentifier,special,"The UniqueIdentifier data type is used to store a globally Uniqueidentifier, the GUID. The GUID is truly globally unique. This number has little chance of being reconstructed in another system. Columns with a unique identifier can be initialized using the NEWID function or by converting a string to a unique identifier"
char,char,"The CHAR data type is used to store fixed-length non-uniform encoding data of a specified length. When defining a column of this type, you must specify the column length. This data type is useful when you always know the length of the data to store. For example, when you store data in a ZIP code plus four characters, you know you're always going to need 10 characters. This data type has a maximum column width of 8000 characters"
varchar,char,"The VARCHAR data type, like the CHAR type, is used to store non-uniform encoding character data. Unlike CHAR, this data type is variable length. When defining a column of this data type, you specify the maximum length of the column. The biggest difference from the CHAR data type is that the length of the store is not the column length, but the length of the data"
text,char,The text data type is used to store large amounts of non-uniform encoded character data. This data type can be up to 231-1 or 2 billion characters
nchar,Uniform Coded Character Type,"The NCHAR data type is used to store fixed-length uniformly encoded character data. Uniform encoding uses a two-byte structure to store each character, rather than a single byte (as in plain text). It allows for a large number of extended characters. This data type can store 4000 characters, doubling the amount of byte space used"
nvarchar,Uniform Coded Character Type,"The NVARCHAR data type is used as variable-length uniformly encoded character data. This data type can store 4000 characters, doubling the amount of byte space used"
ntext,Uniform Coded Character Type,"The ntext data type is used to store large amounts of uniformly encoded character data. This data type can store 230-1, or nearly 1 billion characters, and uses twice as much byte space"
binary,Binary data type,The binary data type is used to store fixed-length binary data up to 8000 bytes long. You should use this data type when the contents of an input table are close to the same length
varbinary,Binary data type,The VarBinary data type is used to store variable-length binary data up to 8000 bytes long. You should use this data type when the contents of an input table are variable in size
image,Binary data type,"The Image data type is used to store variable-length binary data, up to 231-1 or about 2 gigabytes"
